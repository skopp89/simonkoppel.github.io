    <h1>World Happiness & Corruption Analysis</h1>

    <p>
      This project analyzes global perceptions of government corruption using
      data from the World Happiness Report. The analysis explores how perceived
      corruption relates to life expectancy, freedom of choice, and overall
      life satisfaction (“Life Ladder”), with a focused regional analysis on Africa.
    </p>

    <h2>Key Themes</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Perceived corruption by country</li>
      <li>Data uncertainty and interpretation</li>
      <li>Life expectancy and resource need</li>
      <li>Freedom of life choices</li>
      <li>Overall happiness (Life Ladder)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Methods</h2>
    <p>
      The project uses choropleth maps, proportional symbols, and reversed
      symbology to emphasize urgency and resource allocation needs. Special
      attention is given to uncertainty in survey-based data.
    </p>

    <h2>Key Findings</h2>
    <p>
      Nations in Africa show a high concentration of perceived corruption,
      often correlated with lower life expectancy and lower life satisfaction.
      However, freedom of choice does not always align with longevity,
      suggesting more complex social dynamics.
